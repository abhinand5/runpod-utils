# Runpod Utils

TL;DR

I'm one of those people who likes to spin up GPU instances on Runpod for things like:

- Testing out a new model.
- Run evals on a model.
- SFT/DPO experiments.
- Testing my training code.
- Or literally anything where I need a good mid-tier GPUs like RTX 3090.

This repository contains the collection of Dockerfiles and automation scripts (planned) that I use for my LLM work.
